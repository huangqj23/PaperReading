# Figure Placement

In MVP, the skill must plan figure placement even when it cannot extract image files.

## Goal

Plan placeholders for every high-value figure or table that materially helps the note.
Do not collapse the paper down to only 1 to 3 items if the paper clearly has more important visuals.

## What to Prefer

Priority order:
1. study overview or method overview figure
2. data or task-definition figure
3. key result figure or table
4. other supporting figures that clarify a major argument

## Placement Logic

- Put method overview figures in `### 机制流程` when they directly explain the core execution chain
- If the match is weaker or the note does not need that micro-structure, keep them in `方法主线`
- Put data or task figures in `数据与任务定义`
- Put main result figures or tables in `关键结果`
- Put conceptual diagrams in `研究问题` or `深度分析` if they clarify the argument

## What to Read

Use:
- figure captions
- nearby正文对 figure 的引用
- section context
- candidate pages and candidate images from deterministic PDF asset extraction

Do not place figures by paper order alone.
Do not let scripts make the final semantic choice; scripts should only prepare candidates.

## Placeholder-First Rule

- The final note should first have the right placeholder structure.
- If a usable image is extracted and semantically matched with high confidence, replace that placeholder with the real image.
- If a reliable image is not available, keep the placeholder.
- Never silently remove a figure just because extraction failed.
- Text correctness is more important than image completeness.

## Machine Contract Boundary

The generated `writing_contract.figure_table_contract` owns figure/table fields, decision values, candidate statuses, and inspection requirements. Use that contract instead of treating this visual-judgment guide as a second schema.

When the contract requires manual inspection, open the actual candidate image before claiming that a visual review found a defect. Keep missing candidates separate from real materialization failures: `asset_candidate_missing`, an empty source image path, or no independent matching crop means no usable candidate was available; materialization failure means a selected real asset later failed to copy or write.

## Integrated Placement Rule

Every kept placeholder must be placed directly under the most relevant substantive section named by its `建议位置`.
Do not collect unresolved placeholders into a catch-all section such as `剩余图表占位`, `未放置图表`, `Remaining figures`, or `Leftover figures`.

Rejecting an extraction candidate does not by itself require a final-note placeholder. The final placeholder set should come from semantic importance to the note, not from the number of failed extraction candidates.

For survey papers with many representative project figures, appendix tables, or repetitive supplemental visuals:
- keep a callout only when the visual materially helps the reader understand the argument
- otherwise summarize the pattern in prose or point the reader back to the appendix/source paper
- do not stack low-value callouts just to demonstrate that the pipeline saw them

## Visual Quality Gate

Figure/table insertion has two separate gates:
- identity match: the candidate label, caption, and local context match the planned figure/table
- visual usability: the crop actually contains the visual body needed by the reader

A label or caption match is not insertion approval.
Fail closed when visual usability is weak: keep the placeholder instead of inserting the candidate.

Reject candidates that are:
- caption-only crops
- tables with no visible table body
- table crops contaminated by running prose outside the table body or another Figure/Table caption
- figure crops contaminated by another Figure/Table caption or by a second figure body
- large text, title-page, or abstract crops masquerading as figures
- crops where the visual body is tiny relative to the crop

## Rendering Boundary

Use `obsidian-format.md` for final placeholder, image embed, caption, and numbering rules. This guide owns placement and visual judgment, not Markdown rendering.

## When to Skip

If the paper has no informative figures or tables:
- do not force one
- state that no high-value figure placeholder was added
